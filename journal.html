		<h4>Bit Specific Addressing</h4>
		<h5>October 15, 2020</h5>
		<p>The standard way to write to a microcontroller's GPIO output is to perform a read-modify-write operation on the port's data register. 
		Using a mask to modify the read value ensures that you aren't changing the state of any unintended GPIO. The downside is that it ties up 
		the bus for several clock cycles. Ideally you would be able to write directly to specific bits in the register individually and only preform 
		one operation instead of three.</p>
		<p>This problem can be solved using set-only and reset-only registers, but there is another way called "bit specific addressing" that the TM4C uses. 
		The address itself is used as a mask. A base address is defined for each port, and then specific bits are set for each GPIO you want to be able to affect. 
		For example, the base address for port A is 0x40004000. In order to set PA0 high without affecting the other port A pins, you would write 0x1 to address 0x40004004. 
		To set PA2 you write 0x4 to 0x40004010. Since specific address bits are assigned to each GPIO, you can combine them. In order to set PA0 and PA2 at the same time, 
		you would write 0x5 to 0x40004014.</p>
		<p>This method does require 256 addresses for each port in order to write to each combination of port pins, but in a system with millions of addresses this isn't too large of a cost.</p>
		<p>For more information, see Section 10.2.1.2 of the <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TM4C123GH6PM" target="_blank">TM4C123GH6PM datasheet</a>.

		<h5>October 12, 2020</h5>
		<p>My favorite email I've received was from a client. It reads as follows:</p>
		<p>I'M AVAILABLE, BUT THIS MEETING ONLY MAKES SENSE IF (nAME) IS ALSO. XCUSE CAPS.. TOO LAZY TO RETYPE</p>
		<p>I like how when he realized his mistake, he didn't turn caps lock off but instead fully committed.</p>

		<h4>Buck Converter Theory</h4>
		<h5>October 8, 2020</h5>
		<p>A friend linked me to a really good website for buck converters theory: <a href="http://onmyphd.com/?p=voltage.regulators.buck.step.down.converter" target="_blank">On My PhD</a>. There's a bunch of other EE topics as well.

		<h4>Moog Transistor Ladder Analysis</h4>
		<h5>October 3, 2020</h5>
		<p> I found what looks like a <a href="http://timstinchcombe.co.uk/synth/Moog_ladder_tf.pdf" target="_blank">rigorous analysis of the transistor ladder filter</a> by Timothy E. Stinchcombe.
		It will be useful when I make a VCF for my synth.</p>

        <h4>Feedback on the KiCad Page Layout Editor</h4>
		<h5>October 2, 2020</h5>
		<p>I no longer have access to Altium through work, so I'm learning KiCad (v5.1.6). I just made a custom title block and found the interface was awkward. However, given how rare it is to make a new title block, all the things mentioned here are probably low priority.
		<br><br>To place a line, I have to go into a menu to select "place a line", then type in the end point coordinates. The coordinate fields are in the order: Y start, X start, X end, Y end. It would be easier if X was always first. These values are only important in a relative sense because after clicking OK it takes me to the main screen where I can move the line around with the mouse. Why not just let me optionally specify a length or width?
		<br><br>After the line was placed, there was an error with the coordinates. I would place something at (50,75) and it would show in the properties window as something like (50.007,75.003). Not a big deal, but why is this even a thing?
		<br><br>If I want to place a line, there should be either a toolbar button or a hotkey listed in the Place menu. To actually place the line, I should be able to click two places on the screen to place the line end points.
		<br><br>It's hard to move line end points once they exist. I can't drag individual end points and have to instead edit the coordinate fields manually (which are thankfully in a sensible order).
		<br><br>The default move command seems to be to drag to select the thing you want to move. There was a case where I wanted to move two text objects, but not the line between them. I had to move the line as well then move it back because there's no concept of shift clicking to select multiple things.
		<br><br>There's also no way to have nothing selected. This isn't an actual issue, just a bit annoying.
		<br><br>In the design panel, it lists all the entities (like lines, text, ect.). However, it just lists them by "text11:Text" or "segm8:Line" I have to click through each one if I want to find something. I also can't drag them to change the order or sort by entity type. It would be nice if, at least for text, it listed the first few characters in the text string.
		<br><br>You can only select already existing lines by clicking on the endpoint, not anywhere on the line. if two lines have the same end point, a window pops up asking which one of the two you want, but the names you have to select from aren't helpful. I have no idea if the line I want is line 11 or 15.
		<br><br>One neat feature is that you can select the origin location for line end point coordinates, so you can have the bottom left be (0,0) if you want (as opposed to the KiCad standard upper left).
		<br><br>Each line also has an intrinsic repeat/patterning option, which was something of a saving grace.
		<br><br>The process of saving a template file and loading it into a schematic was very intuitive. However, I made a change to the template, saved it, and tried to reload it into the schematic, which didn't change. I'm guessing it saw that the file path didn't change, so it didn't reload the template.</p>

		<h4>SnapEDA Plugins for ECAD</h4>
		<h5>October 1, 2020</h5>
		<p>SnapEDA just sent me a newsletter about their (beta) plugins for Altium and KiCAD. I haven't tried them yet, but they sound like they could be really useful for easily importing 3D models.</p>

		<h4>Mechanical Parts from Haizol</h4>
		<h5>September 8, 2020</h5>
		<p>I recently became aware of <a href="https://haizol.com" target="_blank">Haizol</a>. It's a website that lets you upload mechanical designs for multiple factories in China to bid on. Most production processes are covered. They do seem to have minimum order quantities since most of the RFQs are for thousands of parts, but I did see a few that were for a couple hundred. I guess it depends on what factories are willing to bid on.</p>

		<h4>Electrostatic Force Field</h4>
		<h5>July 26, 2020</h5>
		<p>I came across this interesting account of an <a href="http://amasci.com/weird/unusual/e-wall.html" target="_blank">"Invisible Electrostatic Wall"</a>. Apparently a tape factory built up so much static charge from unrolling giant tape reels that it stopped workers from walking under the tape.</p>

		<h4>Electric Machine Theory</h4>
		<h5>May 31, 2020</h5>
		<p>Dr. Andy Knight maintains <a href="http://people.ucalgary.ca/~aknigh/electrical_machines/fundamentals/f_main.html" target="_blank">a website that covers electric machines</a>. It's pretty rigorous.</p>

		<h4>Electron Microscope Animations</h4>
		<h5>February 23, 2020</h5>
		<p>I'm always impressed with what Ben from Applied Science is able to do. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBIzCp24Ix0" target="_blank">this video</a> he uses an electron microscope to make animations of carbon nanotubes.</p>
