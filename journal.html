		The <a href="https://connectorbook.com/identification.html" target="_blank">Identiconn</a> page is the first tool I've
		seen that can help you identify a header's part number. I'll probably use it backwards to find headers for future projects when

		<h5>January 24, 2022</h5>
		<p>Some years ago during university I read a comment online from an author talking about the type of
		computer they wanted. It would be stripped of most of its functionality, containing only a bare bones
		text editor. No internet access. No email. No games. A distraction free environment to help them get
		work done. Unfortunately, they claimed that every technical person they talked to thought it was a
		terrible idea, that there would be no demand for such a limited computer. I couldn't believe they had
		been rejected so broadly since it seemed like such a common sense idea, so I talked to some of the
		other engineers in my classes about it. To my surprise, they also all thought it wasn't viable. In some
		ways it doesn't make sense. Why would someone pay 50% of the price of a regular computer to get 10% of
		the functionality?</p>

		<p>Years passed and I didn't really think about it until I ran across 
		<a href="https://getfreewrite.com/" target="_blank">Freewrite</a>. It's exactly what the author wanted
		all those years ago. I wonder if they know about it?</p>

		<span class="center"><img src="pictures/journal/model_mania_2010.png" alt="Model Mania part from 2010" /></span>
		
		<p>
		Model Mania is an event at the annual Solidworks conference where people
		try to 3D model a part from a 2D drawing.
		They're then given another drawing of the same part with a few changes to implement.
		Since the entire process is timed it's a good measure of how fast you can model
		unusual shapes and how flexible your model is.<br><br>
		
		They've posted all the previous challenges 
		<a href="https://blogs.solidworks.com/tech/2021/02/22-years-of-model-mania.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
		Since they always make the part	a bit unusal it's interesting to look through them to see what's possible.

		<h5>June 24, 2021</h5>
		<p>
		The first specification for the inter-IC sound (I2S) bus was published by Philips in 1986. I looked it up because
		I needed to know exactly how the master of the bus was determined. It turns out the master is always the device
		supplying the serial and word select clocks, even if it’s not supplying the actual audio data. One surprising thing
		is that it makes no mention of MCLK, a signal that is often included to give devices extra clock cycles to
		do multiple things for every bit of audio data. Since the spec is no longer hosted by Philips, I found it in the
		Internet Archive and have reposted it here for posterity.

		<h4 id="20201212">Saving Data From An Old HP VNA</h4>
		<h5>December 12, 2020</h5>
		
		<p>At a previous job we had on old vector network analyzer, the HP 8753D.</p>
			
		<span class="center"><img src="pictures/journal/HP-8753D.jpg" alt="HP 8753D" /></span>			
		<p style="text-align:center">HP 8753-D (picture from ebay)</p>
			
		<p>It was fairly old, but like most old RF equipment it was built to last. (Although I think there's some selection bias in
		that statement.) We used it for trimming the length of antennas until they were resonant in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. In other words, 
		"make the antenna shorter until the S11 valley was centred at 2.44 GHz". The final length was recorded and the antenna design was
		changed in the next PCB release.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately the VNA was so old that it didn't have a USB port or any other easy way to save data. An antenna would be tuned,
		but the only data that was saved was the final antenna length. Things like resonant frequency, bandwidth, or input impedance were
		lost.</p>
		<p>What the VNA did have was a floppy disk drive. I found some floppy disks burried in storage and borrowed our greybeard tech's
		USB floppy disk reader. The VNA was meant to output to a plotter, a device that's basically a CNC machine holding a pen.
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKB8dn85XFXTqpymt03P0VA" target="_blank">Here's a video showing one in action.</a>
		This meant that the VNA could output HPGL (Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language) files to the floppy disk. HPGL is kind of interesting
		because it's pretty human readable. The commands are all abbreviations of their names, unlike G-code.
		<a href="https://www.isoplotec.co.jp/HPGL/eHPGL.htm" target="_blank">Here's a handy reference guide.</a></p>
		<p>So with the floppy reader I was able to get plotter output from the VNA onto my computer. But how to render it? I tried a few
		different programs, both installed and online, and the most useful one was
		<a href="https://service-hpglview.web.cern.ch/" target="_blank">HP-GL Viewer</a>, which is maintained by CERN. After tweaking the
		output a bit I was able to print to PDF and then convert to an image. The end result is shown below. Markers are used to record
		important numerical values.</p>
		
		<span class="center"><img src="pictures/journal/VNA_S11_output.png" alt="output exported from VNA" /></span>
		
		<p>This method produces plots that are the same size, so you can flip through a folder of them in an image viewer and the plot axis
		won't move. This makes it easy to compare different outputs.</p>
		<p>One cool thing about the HPGL output is that the section of code that draws the data line is a series of goto commands for the pen.
		It's a bunch of x,y coordinates that can easily be cleaned up in a spreadsheet, then input into a plotting program like
		<a href="https://www.padowan.dk/download/" target="_blank">Graph</a>. The data is in "plotter units" instead of frequency and dB, but
		you can use the marker values to scale it if you want. Although if you're going to go to all that effort, you'll probably just want to
		poke around the VNA until you find the export data command.</p>

		<h5>November 3, 2020</h5>
		<p>A horse walks into a bar. The bartender says "Why the long face?" The horse says "I've just realized I'm a metaphysical concept 
		within a fictional narrative, and will cease to exist at the end of this sentence."</p>

		<h4 id="20201015">Bit Specific Addressing</h4>
		<h5>October 15, 2020</h5>
		<p>The standard way to write to a microcontroller's GPIO output is to perform a read-modify-write operation on the port's data register. 
		It's necessary to use a mask to modify the read value to ensure that the state of any non-target GPIO isn't inadvertantly changed. The downside
		of this method is that it ties up the bus for several clock cycles. Ideally you would be able to write directly to specific bits in the register
		individually and only preform one operation instead of three.</p>
		<p>This problem can be solved using set-only and reset-only registers, but there is another way called "bit specific addressing" that the TM4C uses. 
		The address itself is used as a mask. A base address is defined for each port, and then specific bits are set for each GPIO you want to be able to affect. 
		For example, the base address for port A is 0x40004000. In order to set PA0 high without affecting the other port A pins, you would write 0x1 to address 0x40004004. 
		To set PA2 you write 0x4 to 0x40004010. Since specific address bits are assigned to each GPIO, you can combine them. In order to set PA0 and PA2 at the same time, 
		you would write 0x5 to 0x40004014.</p>
		<p>This method does require 256 addresses for each port in order to write to each combination of port pins, but in a system with billions of addresses this isn't too large of a cost.</p>
		<p>For more information, see Section 10.2.1.2 of the <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TM4C123GH6PM" target="_blank">TM4C123GH6PM datasheet</a>.

        <h4 id="20201002">Feedback on the KiCad Page Layout Editor</h4>
		<h5>October 2, 2020</h5>
		<p>I no longer have access to Altium through work, so I'm learning KiCad (v5.1.6). I just made a custom title block and found the interface was awkward. However, given how rare it is to make a new title block, all the things mentioned here are probably low priority.
		<br><br>To place a line, I have to go into a menu to select "place a line", then type in the end point coordinates. The coordinate fields are in the order: Y start, X start, X end, Y end. It would be easier if X was always first. These values are only important in a relative sense because after clicking OK it takes me to the main screen where I can move the line around with the mouse. Why not just let me optionally specify a length or width?
		<br><br>After the line was placed, there was an error with the coordinates. I would place something at (50,75) and it would show in the properties window as something like (50.007,75.003). Not a big deal, but why is this even a thing?
		<br><br>If I want to place a line, there should be either a toolbar button or a hotkey listed in the Place menu. To actually place the line, I should be able to click two places on the screen to place the line end points.
		<br><br>It's hard to move line end points once they exist. I can't drag individual end points and have to instead edit the coordinate fields manually (which are thankfully in a sensible order).
		<br><br>The default move command seems to be to drag to select the thing you want to move. There was a case where I wanted to move two text objects, but not the line between them. I had to move the line as well then move it back because there's no concept of shift clicking to select multiple things.
		<br><br>There's also no way to have nothing selected. This isn't an actual issue, just a bit annoying.
		<br><br>In the design panel, it lists all the entities (like lines, text, ect.). However, it just lists them by "text11:Text" or "segm8:Line" I have to click through each one if I want to find something. I also can't drag them to change the order or sort by entity type. It would be nice if, at least for text, it listed the first few characters in the text string.
		<br><br>You can only select already existing lines by clicking on the endpoint, not anywhere on the line. if two lines have the same end point, a window pops up asking which one of the two you want, but the names you have to select from aren't helpful. I have no idea if the line I want is line 11 or 15.
		<br><br>One neat feature is that you can select the origin location for line end point coordinates, so you can have the bottom left be (0,0) if you want (as opposed to the KiCad standard upper left).
		<br><br>Each line also has an intrinsic repeat/patterning option, which was something of a saving grace.
		<br><br>The process of saving a template file and loading it into a schematic was very intuitive. However, I made a change to the template, saved it, and tried to reload it into the schematic, which didn't change. I'm guessing it saw that the file path didn't change, so it didn't reload the template.</p>

		<p>I recently became aware of <a href="https://haizol.com" target="_blank">Haizol</a>. It's a website that lets you upload mechanical designs for multiple factories in China to bid on. Most production processes are covered. They do seem to have minimum order quantities since most of the RFQs are for thousands of parts, but I did see a few that were for a couple hundred. I guess it depends on what factories are willing to bid on.</p>

 - He sent some word salad
 - What I understood from his instructions was to check to make sure none of the characters changed
 - I wrote the email I sent out in a paranoid manner. I wrote both emails in notepad and checked every character to make sure it didn't change
 - I copied one of them into Skype for him to approve. Again I checked the password in the skype message didn't change
 - I then copied both text files into gmail, ready to send them.
 - I checked the password strings one final time to make sure none of the characters had changed.
 - I sent the emails then went home for the weekend.
 - First thing Monday boss tells me that there was some mistake with the passwords. He said he didn't know what happened and asked if I had any ideas.
 - I looked over our skype message history and saw that the passwords I had sent out were the reverse of what he had sent to me in Skype. The conversation ended with the acknowledgement that I had gotten the passwords mixed up.
 - I felt really bad about this, so I looked over all the details of the situation again.
 - I saw the little pen next to the two messages he had sent me
 - I looked up how to download Skype message history. Unfortunately they don't keep the original text of messages you edit, but they do keep the edit times. The edits to the password messages happened within a half hour of him sending me a message telling me there was something wrong and asking what happened, over the weekend.
 - In other words, he already knew that he had sent me the wrong passwords and edited his messages to make it look like he hadn't. 
I don't give any credit to the idea that he just wanted to fix incorrect information.
Also, he approved my demo message, which had the password in it.
 - In summary, he he directly blamed me for mixing up the passwords when it was him.
 - This is the point where I stopped trusting him and saving screenshots of our skype conversations
  - it turns out by "check the passwords" he meant "try to log in with them" and it was my fault for not reading his mind.

		<p>I'm always impressed with what Ben from Applied Science is able to do. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBIzCp24Ix0" target="_blank">this video</a> he uses an electron microscope to make animations of carbon nanotubes.</p>
