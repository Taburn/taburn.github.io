        <h1>Audio IO Switch</h1>
		
		<p><a href="https://github.com/Taburn/Audio-IO-Switch" target="_blank">Github repo.</a></p>
		
		<p>
		I found I was switching my headphones between my phone and computer a lot, which was kind of annoying. This was a quick project
		to make it easier that became more complicated than it should have.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Version 1</h2>
		<span class="center"><img src="../pictures/projects/Audio_IO_Switch/inside_v1.jpg" alt="Inside" /></span>
		<span class="center"><img src="../pictures/projects/Audio_IO_Switch/top_v1.jpg" alt="Top" /></span>
		<span class="center"><img src="../pictures/projects/Audio_IO_Switch/UI_v1.jpg" alt="UI" /></span>
		
		<p>The label is a full sheet sticker that I ran through a printer and cut out. A rocker switch was chosen for its low profile and
		satisfying click, and I already had the enclosure.</p>
		
		<p>I ordered a bunch of cheap TRS jacks from china, which proved to be a really bad idea. They came without nuts and the thread was a 
		non-standard one. I took them to both the machine shop at the UofA and a custom audio system business, but they couldn't identify it.
		However, the guy at the audio place did pull a nut off a cheap mixing console with similar jacks that fit mine. Whatever
		this thread was, it seems to be a chinese standard. Since I couldn't find nuts for them, I ended up just hot gluing them into the enclosure.
		The hot glue ended up failing (like it usually does) from the insertion force of the cable.</p>
		
		<p>The potentiometer was also disappointing. When I turned the knob, the left and right audio channel volume would change at different rates.
		I didn't know this before, but apparently manufacturers have a hard time matching the resistive wafers inside dual gang pots.</p>
		
		<p>This version also took a lot of effort to solder. I definitely wouldn't want to do a batch of 10, or even 5, of them. There had to be a better way.</p>
		
		<h2>Version 2</h2>
		
		<span class="center"><img src="../pictures/projects/Audio_IO_Switch/inside_v2.jpg" alt="Inside" /></span>
		<span class="center"><img src="../pictures/projects/Audio_IO_Switch/top_v2.jpg" alt="Top" /></span>
		<span class="center"><img src="../pictures/projects/Audio_IO_Switch/UI_v2.jpg" alt="UI" /></span>
		
		<p>Version 2 focused around making everything easy to assemble, which meant the only soldering I wanted to do was on a PCB.</p>
		
		<p>I came across the idea of using a PCB as a face plate, which seemed promising. It's easy to add holes in precise locations in an ECAD program,
		and you get free text and art in the silkscreen layer. The enclosure I was using had a 1.6 mm thick face plates, which is a standard PCB thickness.</p>
		
		<p>I measured the face plate that came with the enclosure and reproduced the outline. The corner curvature took a few tries to get right, comparing
		it with the 3D model of the enclosure I imported into Altium. The hole Y locations were derived from the component datasheets, then checked by exporting
		the PCB as a step file and importing it into the main board's PCB file. </p>
		
		<p>The graphic is <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mandala_52.svg" target="_blank">Mandala_52</a> from Wikipedia, which is available
		under the CC A-SA license.</p>
		
		<p>The main board's outline was given in the datasheet for the enclosure. There were no rocker switches that were both through hole and panel mount,
		so I used a toggle switch. Putting it between the TRS jacks will hopefully let the cables protect it a bit.</p>
		
		<p>Assembly was pretty easy. I put all the parts together, minus the top of the enclosure, then tightened the nuts on the jacks and switches. Then I put
		the top on and took the bottom off, which exposed the solder pads while keeping everything lined up. Soldering took ~5 minutes and I was able to put the
		bottom back and screw it closed.</p>
		
		<h3>Testing</h3>
		<p>Everything beeped out correctly, but what I really want to do is measure the channel isolation. Ideally I would connect it to an 
		<a href="https://www.ap.com/" target="_blank">Audio Precision</a> system and measure all the transfer functions vs frequency, but I don't have access
		to one right now. I do have some TRS to BNC cables coming, but they were delayed by Covid and won't arrive until next month, and I'm not in enough of a
		rush to hack my own cables.</p>

		<p>The PCBs came from <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/" target="_blank">JLCPCB</a> as part of a larger order, so the shipping and import fees cost maybe $5
		per set of 3 boards?</p>
		
		<p>In total, the unit cost of one Audio IO Switch was $35. However, if I built a run of 100, it would drop to $26.50. According to 
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwrkfHadeQQ&t=57s" target="_blank">Dave from EEVblog</a>, that means I should charge $65/unit. I think
		the build quality is high enough that it will last years (the weakest link is probably the jacks), but I'm not sure if there would be enough demand.
		I suppose I could try selling on <a href="https://www.tindie.com/" target="_blank">Tindie</a> to see if anyone else was interested.</p>
		
		<p>If I did start selling, I'd probably try to get a plastic label of some sort. The paper sticker one isn't water proof.</p>
		
		<p>In any case, I'm really pleased with how it came together. I think it's really polished.</p>
